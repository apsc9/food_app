- package.json is a configuration for npm, keeps track of what version of a package is installed into our system
- Dependencies mainly of these 2 types can be installed :
   - Dev dependencies and the other is normal dependencies (used in dev only)
   - normal dependencies (used in prod as well)
- ^2.8.2 , this ^ is called caret, parcel will automatically update the version in case of minor feature upgrade
- if you put tilde (~)., then there will be install major version automatically
- Its safe to put ^ , and not ~ as with major update, a lot of things might break in case of major update 
- package-lock.json keeps track of the exact version of the package that is being installed
- Integrity : package-lock.json keeps a hash to verify that whatever is there on dev machine , the same file is deployed onto the prod, keeps track of versions of all the packages
- parcel as a project has its own dependencies which in turn can have their own dependencies which is known as  transitive dependencies
- with the help of package.json and package-lock.json, you can recreate the node modules
- // ReactElement(Object) => HTML(Browser understands) , 
// react element is converted in to HTML while it rendering on to the DOM, 
- npx means executing a package
- cdn links is not a good way to bring react and reacty dom into your project, fetching from cdn is a costly operation, 
- Its better to have react in our node modules, we can import it easliy that way
- Also it is easier to maintain react as a depencency if we have it in package.json
- so we now install react as a package to our code
- For build use this command: npx parcel build index.html
- By default , package.json has "main": "App.js", specified, so we remove this in order to avoid conflicts with parcel, you dont need ("main": "App.js") when you are using parcel
- dev builds are put in the folder dist, also prod build will also be be dist folder
- Anything that can be regenerated, you can put it under gitignore
- to make our app compatible with the older browser versions, we will use browserslist
but we need to tell it what all browsers we need to be supported for our app
